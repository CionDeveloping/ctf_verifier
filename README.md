# Code Verification System

This was my intro project to php.

The Code Verification System is a tool designed to track and reward users who have completed a task or challenge. 
When a user visits the website, they are prompted to enter a security code. 
If the code is correct, the user is added to the scoreboard and a notification is sent to the administrator via Discord (using a webhook). 
The system also has the capability to automatically generate a new code once a code has been used, and the administrator will receive a notification with the new code via Discord. 
This system was originally developed for use in a Capture the Flag (CTF) scenario, where students could "claim" a CTF by finding and entering the correct code.
However, it could be adapted for a variety of other use cases as well.

 It is more of a teaching project for myself than a tool that is actually useful in a practical sense.
